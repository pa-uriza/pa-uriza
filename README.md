### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Mechanical and Industrial engineer who enjoys challenges and looks forward to learning new things all the time. I am interested in robotics, machine learning, and data science. I am keen to apply my knowledge in order to find efficient and creative solutions. I am motivated to work in multidisciplinary schemes in which I can learn from my co-workers. I am an organized and self-driven person, very dedicated to my work, that adapts easily to different responsibilities. Currently I am a Data Scientist and an Educator.
